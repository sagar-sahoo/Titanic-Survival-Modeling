# Titanic-Survival-Modeling

This is the legendary Titanic ML Dataset â€“ the ideal dataset to dive into ML  and familiarize yourself with ML Case Studies.

The Problem Statement is simple: use machine learning to create an efficient Model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.


Goal for this Notebook:

Analysis and Application of Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Survival Prediction of Titanic.

This Notebook will include:

1.  Cleaning Data: Feature Engineering, Missing Values, Imputations

2.  Exploring Data

3.  Model Selection and Evaluation:
Supervised Machine learning Techniques:  Logitistic Regression Model + + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Decision Trees + Random Forest + Extra Trees + Gradient Boosting + Ada Boost + Xtreme Gradient Boosting +
Evaluation of the Models + Identify Key Features
